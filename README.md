# Cognous Governed Exchange

**Governed exchange and continuity for a bounded synthetic workflow.**

## Overview

An experimental GAX/IMX reference that connects governed messages, recipient assessment, bounded execution and retained evidence. It is separate from the constitutional authority repository: this workbench implements exchange behavior and local transport, not an institution or a constitution.

**Implementation status:** this README describes merged public reference work. Component acceptance, selection in the hub and execution of a qualification are separate facts. The selected revision for this component is `9984d9011568ccdf3d562fa9760ad41368947b34`; the [hub lock](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/5737267d94d2b445735c95e8480a31de73a2abe8/component-lock.json) is the source of that integration choice.

## Purpose and intended users

Message receipt, understanding, acceptance, authorization and execution are different events. A recipient must preserve those distinctions when messages are duplicated, acknowledgements are lost or a workflow resumes under changed authority.

Engineers can inspect the reference contracts and examples; enterprise architecture, security and governance reviewers can examine the boundary and evidence. Evaluate this component for its named responsibility rather than as a complete governance platform.

## Key features

| Capability | Implemented or specified responsibility |
|---|---|
| **GAX assessment** | Assess message structure, supported profile, identity binding, references, freshness and permitted handling. |
| **Local durable transport** | Queue, deliver and redeliver messages while retaining their association with recipient outcomes. |
| **Public runtime integration** | Invoke supported Control Plane and executor interfaces with caller-supplied resolver, execution policy, observation policy and trusted time. |
| **Retained artifacts** | Expose original Replay, ODES and IMX artifacts with identities and content commitments. |
| **Recovery and continuity** | Reconcile original effects, retain derivative lineage and preserve predecessor commitments without making successor loading an execution grant. |

## How it works

LocalDurableTransport delivers a synthetic refund message to AcceptedGaxRecipientAdapter. GAX assesses the message and routes the Manifest-bound proposal through the trusted runtime. Redelivery returns the retained original artifacts when available. If evidence was never retained after an effect, evidence-only recovery creates an explicitly derived record without issuing a replacement effect.

A valid signature, chain inclusion, message receipt, reasoning instruction or evidence-package digest does not authorize execution. Institutional authority must be supplied and evaluated through the appropriate trusted boundary.

## Getting started

For a complete environment with exact dependencies, follow the [hub developer quickstart](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md). The [exchange demo](experiments/odex_gax_imx_reference/README.md) has separate prerequisites and writes an illustrative JSON artifact; it is not the transported, effect-producing qualification. Consult the [transport profile](experiments/governed_message_transport/profile.md) before treating receipt as any stronger state.

## Evidence and supported scope

The hub selects accepted merge `9984d9011568ccdf3d562fa9760ad41368947b34`: bounded refund exchange 0.1.0, retained artifacts 1.1.0 and recipient result 1.0.0. The public runtime uses supported executor interfaces, not upstream test helpers. Authority Context comes from [the separate constitutional repository](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-institutional-governance).

The accepted [hub persistence-generation evidence](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/5737267d94d2b445735c95e8480a31de73a2abe8/examples/control-plane-store-adoption/qualification-summary.json) records 915 Python tests in each of two repetitions, 35 matrix entries satisfying their gates and 120 separate mocked OpenShell tests. Those are aggregate hub results, not a per-component test count or a claim of production readiness. Optional behavioral layers receive static checks only. The [support ledger](https://github.com/cogno-us/cognous-open-control-stack/blob/main/docs/release-status.md) separates implementation, execution and adoption.

## Limitations and deployment decisions

This is a bounded refund profile, not full GAX conformance, a production network or institutional authentication. Message IDs and receipt do not authorize actions. Current recovery can be denied while historical applied evidence remains true. Deferred Alvorada PR #2 is excluded from the hub; no pending branch supplies supported behavior.

Review original artifacts and their exact source revisions before extending a claim to a new environment. New dependencies, authority sources, destinations or enforcement mechanisms need their own compatibility and qualification. A passing reference case is not a certification of an enterprise deployment.
